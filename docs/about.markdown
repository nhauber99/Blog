Hi, I'm Niklas and this is my blog where I'm posting about interesting stuff I'm working on. Currently most of my time is devoted to my [material scanner](http://127.0.0.1:4000/Blog/2023/01/08/MaterialScanner.html) and for now my posts will be about anything related to this project.

Some basic knowledge about computer graphics may be advantageous for understanding the articles posted on this blog.
